# Proxy Scanner

Quickly scans a list of proxies and saves results

### About
Just simply put your proxies in `proxies.txt` and run `npm start` command.
The program is going to filter only working proxies which support `https`, as well as `wss` connection.

Even considering all of this, some of them may die after some time for obvious reasons. So you need to regularly update your list.
